# hello-world
A simple c++ program in the tradition of printing "Hello world!" as ones first console application.

This repository won't be useful to anybody and is really just a waste of disk space. I use it to experiment with GitHub. If you're a weird person and want to reuse this code, you can go ahead and do so. It's free software licensed under the GNU GPL v. 3.0 license wich is really overkill for a application this size. Seriously, the License is a gazillion times bigger than the application. But whatever, have fun!
